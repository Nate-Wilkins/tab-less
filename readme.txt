This extension disables tabbed browsing in Google Chrome. Rather than opening new tabs, Chrome will open windows wherever possible.

These are common reactions I get when I tell people about this extension:

* Why would you want to disable tabs?

Because I always find it difficult to find the tab I'm looking for. Tabs obscure the browsing experience, and I find it far easier to browse the web when I can see all of my windows at once. Most modern operating systems can arrange windows elegantly and efficiently, making tabs defunct.

* If you don't like tabs, then just don't use them! You don't need an extension for that

Chrome forces tabs on you by default. It does not provide an option to default to using windows rather than tabs. This extension overrides that behaviour to open windows instead, to make it seamless for users like myself.

All of the code for this extension is open-sourced and can be found online at https://github.com/iainbeeston/tab-less. I'd be happy to receive any feedback, hear about any bugs or accept any pull-requests for new code at that address.
